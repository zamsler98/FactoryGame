I'll update `src/main.rs` to use `GRAY` for every tile by replacing the alternating color expression with a single `GRAY` value. Applying the file edit now.

I will re-read `src/main.rs` (required by the edit tool) and then apply the change.
Now I'll apply the edit to replace the alternating color expression with `GRAY`.
[92m[1m| [0m[90m Edit     [0msrc/main.rs
Edit applied. I'll run `cargo fmt` to format the code as required by AGENTS.md (you asked not to run tests/build; formatting is safe). Then I'll show the changed file snippet.

**Change applied**

- File updated: `src/main.rs:90`
- Replaced the alternating tile color with a single grey color so every tile is now `GRAY`.

What I changed:
- Replaced
  - `if (x + y) % 2 == 0 { GRAY } else { LIGHTGRAY },`
- With
  - `GRAY,`

I ran `cargo fmt` to format the code (as requested in AGENTS.md). You asked not to build, run tests, or commit — I did not run `cargo build`/`cargo test`/make any commits.

If you want a different shade (e.g., `LIGHTGRAY` or `DARKGRAY`) or want the tiles to use a custom RGB color, tell me which and I’ll update it.
